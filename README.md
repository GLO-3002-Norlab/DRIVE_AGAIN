DRIVE is an open-source uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV) training dataset gathering protocol.
This protocol automates the task of driving the UGV to gather a training dataset, then used to train a motion model. The resulting model can then be used for controllers.

## Documentation and Tutorials

Quick link for the [documentation](https://drive-again.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Those tutorials are written using Markdown syntax and stored in the project's `/docs` folder. Their scope ranges from how to use the project to technical documentation for more experienced developer on how to extend the codebase.

## Installation

Although we suggest to use the tutorials, here is a quick version of it

### Natively

1. Create venv with python 3.10
2. Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -e .
```

3. Run the project

```sh
python src/DRIVE_AGAIN/app.py
```

### Docker

1. Build the dockerfile

```sh
docker build -t drive_again .
```

2. Run the app

```sh
docker run -p 5000:5000 drive_again
```

## Test

```sh
python -m pytest
```

## Coverage
```sh
coverage run --source=DRIVE_AGAIN -m pytest
```
and then run
```sh
coverage report
```
or alternatively, for a nicer result, run
```sh
coverage html
```
and open the generated HTML file

> Note that in order for changes in the base code to be applied, you will need to run `pip install .` between test runs.
