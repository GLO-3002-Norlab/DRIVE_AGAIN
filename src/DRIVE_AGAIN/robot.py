    """
    The Robot class provides a simple interface to connect DRIVE to your robot's control, navigation and localization
    systems. This class must be configured for each robot platform you want to use with DRIVE. First, you need to
    provide how to send control commands and goal poses to your robot. Then, you need to configure your system to
    call the necessary functions to update the robot's state.

    See drive_ros_bridge.py for an example of how to use this class with ROS2.
